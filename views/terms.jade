        p
          | I understand that the COVID-19 health screening is a 
          span.inline-bold-underline daily requirement
          |  and must be completed prior to reporting to work.

        p 
          | If at any point I develop any COVID-19 symptoms or believe that I have been exposed to COVID-19 I will not report to MWA for work, and will properly notify Human Resources (HR) as detailed below.
          span.inline-bold-italic   I will not return to work until I receive confirmation from HR that I have satisfied the standard quarantine/isolation period. Note: Standard CDC timeframe is 10-days to return to work for close contacts or cases. 
          | 


        p   Failure to follow these guidelines creates a health and safety risk to you and your fellow MWA staff and students. If you have any questions regarding COVID-19 including symptoms or screening questions please refer to the 
          a(href="/") CDC
          |  for more information. 

        p By completing this acknowledgment, you agree to have answered the questions honestly. Any employee who has falsified this information will be subject to disciplinary action. You also acknowledge that if at any time, you begin to exhibit symptoms before or during your shift, you are 
          span.inline-bold-underline required
          |  to notify HR and your supervisor immediately.
